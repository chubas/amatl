= Integration with desktop environments =

At first, Amatl widgets are being implemented for Gnome desktop environments. Compatibility with other environments should be available using Gtk/Gnome libraries (untested)

== Integration with window managers ==

Part of the accessibility layer can be provided by composite managers, such as [http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/ Compiz-Fusion]. Plans exist to port Amatl as a compiz-fusion plugin (optional), to provide core window management for the widget themselves.
