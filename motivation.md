# Motivation #

While there are other desktop widget alternatives, neither of them really seem to favor two things:
  * **Usability**
  * **Ease of creation and customization**

## Usability ##

Desktop widgets are mean to be **accesible**. Unfortunately, with current desktop widget design, for them to be accesible, one has to get access to desktop, which means losing focus on the current window, and moving the cursor where the widget may be. For a widget to be truly effective, user has to be able to access it from anywhere (not only from desktop), and has not to be intrusive.

## Customization ##

### Widget customization ###

Widgets should be easily customizable not only by the developer, but for the end user. A degree of customization should be offered to the user; the developer should provide these customization points. Amatl widget architecture will favor ease of customization for the users instead of for developers.

### Behavior customization ###

Amatl widgets will be coordinated by a 'manager', a program which will respond to keyboard shortcuts, and will present the widgets to the user in the way the user wants.
