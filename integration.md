# Integration with desktop environments #

At first, Amatl widgets are being implemented for Gnome desktop environments. Compatibility with other environments should be available using Gtk/Gnome libraries (untested)

## Integration with window managers ##

Part of the accessibility layer can be provided by composite managers, such as [Compiz-Fusion](http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/). Plans exist to port Amatl as a compiz-fusion plugin (optional), to provide core window management for the widget themselves.
